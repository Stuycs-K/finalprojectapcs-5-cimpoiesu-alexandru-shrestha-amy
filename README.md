# Project Description

lorem ipsum.

# Intended usage:

A description as to how the project will be used (describe the user interface). (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)

A start screen will appear and the player is able to start the game with an intended level, or the original, level 1. As blocks fall from the top of a screen, the player can use arrow keys to move the block (left/right), turn the block (up), and accelerate the block downwards in its current position (down). The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible by clearing full rows of blocks. Each row cleared will increase the score by 1; every 10 rows cleared increases the level by 1. When the level increases, the blocks will fall at a faster rate, providing less time to think.
