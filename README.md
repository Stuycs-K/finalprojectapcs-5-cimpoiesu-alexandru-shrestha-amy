# Project Description
This is a Tetris game where you can rotate blocks, see the next block, move the block, and accelerate the block using different keys. Levels will ramp up in speed every 10 lines/rows you clear—-this happens when the entire row is completely filled with blocks—-and the score will increase by 100*level each row cleared. Once a row is cleared, it will end up disappearing. Each block that falls is randomly picked and is a specific block of the 7 distinct Tetrominos that exist in Tetris with its specific color. You can see the next block in a window to the right of the screen for the blocks, and below that is text that tells you what your level, score, and the number of rows you cleared (lines) are.  

# Intended usage:
The player is starts the game at level 1. A block will appear and as it falls from the top of a screen, the player can use arrow keys to move the block (left/right), turn the block (up), and accelerate the block downwards in its current position (down). The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible by clearing full rows of blocks. Each row cleared will increase the score by 100 * current level; every 10 rows cleared increases the level by 1. When the level increases, the blocks will fall at a faster rate. A pause button is available to pause the game at any time. There is also a restart button that can be clicked when the game is happening. When the game ends, the restart button will not work. There is no win screen, but when the player loses the game (when any stack of blocks reaches past the top of the block screen), they are shown their score.  

**Control Keys:**  
Left arrow key - Move the current block left one space  
Right arrow key - Move the current block right one space  
Up arrow key - Rotate the current block clockwise by 90 degrees  
Down arrow key - Accelerates the current block  

**Cheat Codes:**
"1" key - level up (speed up blocks, will not change score or lines)  
"2" key - level down (speed down blocks, will not change score or lines)  
"3" key - setup for a 4-block combo  

**Buttons:**
Pause - pauses the blocks in the program, cannot use keys  
Restart - restart all progress (only works before game over screen)
