# Proposals

Tetris:
We intend on creating tetris where you can rotate blocks, store blocks and so that you can see the upcoming block so you know whether you want to use the next block. There will be a pause menu and a startup menu that will allow you to organically move between games or pause it if you don’t want to play anymore. There will also be levels that ramp up in speed after you reach certain point thresholds and the level and blocks placed will also be displayed. Like tetris the blocks will be different colored and the row will end up disappearing if the row gets completely filled. There will also be only a limited amount of possible blocks that can be made and the order that they come will be randomly picked. The link here is pretty similar to the scope we are aiming for.

Chess:
We will be making chess a two player game, where one player ends up moving and then the other player ends up moving, locally. When pieces are captured, the piece that is captured will be removed and displayed off of the board on the opponent's side. There will also be a counter that tracks who has the material advantage in the game with a number like +1 being displayed on a person’s side if they have 1 more pawn than the other person. After a game finishes from checkmate or a person resigns, there will be a button for that, the sides will swap and the person who was playing black will go white. There will also be an ability to input the length of the game, with there also being presets like 5 minutes or 3+2 (3 minutes but you get 2 seconds back when you move). Like chess every piece will only be allowed to move to squares that are allowed for that piece to move to which will be highlighted.

Solitaire:
	It will work by having a randomly picked series of cards come out that will each have
	own models and the person will then try and stack cards following the rules of solitaire
(one less in rank and opposite color). There will be counters for the amount of cards and
	the total time elapsed and once no more cards can be stacked you will either fail if you
have more cards or win if you successfully sorted them by suits. There will also be the
ability to save cards for later, of each suit, starting from aces. You also will be able to
undo moves since that is common in many solitaire games.

(most of these will be extremely similar to the links provided)
