### 2025-05-19 - Prototype Document
Modified prototype document, including the outline of the classes, methods, the UML diagram, formatting, etc. Set timeline/deadlines and intended pacing for the project. Spent around 35 minutes.

### 2025-05-20 - Prototype Document
Fixed formatting, minor fixes to diagram, changed team name, and devised possible coding methods based on diagram. Spent around 25 minutes.

### 2025-05-22 - UML Diagram
Changed and updated UML diagram. Spent 40 minutes.

### 2025-05-23 - Block Class
Updated UML diagram and PROTOTYPE.md by adding an extra class to hold the game together. Also worked on devising Block class methods. Spent approx. 30 minutes.

### 2025-05-27 - Block Class
Fixed timeline on PROTOTYPE.md. Testing processing methods to get visual board on screen, and worked on interface. Created display(), move(), update(), etc. Spent approx. 2 hours 10 minutes.

### 2025-05-28 - Block Movements
Created getter functions for x & y of Block. Updated move() function to move based on key pressed. Edited UML and fixed boundaries for 4-Block. Spent approx. 1 hour 10 minutes.

### 2025-05-29 - "I" Block
Creating a 4-Block array (Tetromino). Fixed all methods to suit the block array and fixed left/right movement, accelerate movement, and working on turning movement. Worked on making Tetromino have "blocky" motion moving downwards and adding more set/get methods. Spent approx. 2 hours.

### 2025-05-30 - Game Class
Fixed endGame() text, and update it to stop the update() of all the blocks using noLoop(). Updated level and score increasing mechanisms in clearRow(). Also fixed nextBlock() to randomly choose block from blockType. Spent approx. 40 minutes.

### 2025-05-01 - Accelerate
Fixed accelerate error with a Tetromino (4 Block) and modified all code to a Block array. Spent approx. 2 hours.

### 2025-06-02 - NextBlock and Boundaries
Fixing boundaries, needNextBlock(), and acceleration on a 2D block array of Tetrominos. Spent approx. 3 hours 50 minutes.

### 2025-06-03 - Visual Fixes & Next Block
Fixing bugs and visual interface (game screen, end screen). Modified code so nextBlock displays in correct position. Level will increase for every 10 rows, speeding up the block each time. Spend approx. 60 minutes.

### 2025-06-03 - Lines Cleared
Added lines cleared (rowsCleared) on visual interface, fixed score increase and block randomization for first block. Spend approx. 40 minutes.

### 2025-06-04 to 2025-06-05 - Mechanics
Fixing score/level increases, block colors, endGame() text, added cheats for increasing/decreasing level (with appropriate increasing/decreasing speeds), set a win function.


Alexandru Cimpoiesu - I believe this document accurately reflects the contributions of my teamate.
