# Technical Details:
Period 5
(Placeholder group name)
We intend on creating tetris where you can rotate blocks, store blocks and so that you can see the upcoming block so you know whether you want to use the next block. There will be a pause menu and a startup menu that will allow you to organically move between games or pause it if you donâ€™t want to play anymore. There will also be levels that ramp up in speed after you reach certain point thresholds and the level and blocks placed will also be displayed. Like tetris the blocks will be different colored and the row will end up disappearing if the row gets completely filled. There will also be only a limited amount of possible blocks that can be made and the order that they come will be randomly picked.

The MVP will essentially be tetris but mainly focused on making sure the block class works correctly and it will be focused on their creation, randomization, and making sure that they move down and the row gets deleted when the row is full of them. Along with this there will still be all the variables like level and score since these are relatively simple to implement and will help make our prototype more fleshed out. Adding on, there will also be progression in levels since that doesn't change the code very much. Basically, it will be a barebones showcase of the block object and it will properly interact with the others to make sure that the general function of the game is working.
